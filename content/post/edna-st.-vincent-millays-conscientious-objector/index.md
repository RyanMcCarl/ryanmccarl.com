I discovered one of the best poems on war I've ever read the other day while reading David P. Barash's <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Approaches-Peace-Reader-Studies/dp/0195123867">Approaches to Peace</a></span>, an excellent edited volume on peace and conflict studies:<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">Conscientious Objector</span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"><br /></span><span style="font-style:italic;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">Edna St. Vincent Millay</span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"><br /><br />I shall die, but<br />that is all that I shall do for Death.<br />I hear him leading his horse out of the stall;<br />I hear the clatter on the barn-floor.<br />He is in haste; he has business in Cuba,<br />business in the Balkans,<br />many calls to make this morning.<br />But I will not hold the bridle<br />while he cinches the girth.<br />And he may mount by himself:<br />I will not give him a leg up.<br /><br />Though he flick my shoulders with his whip,<br />I will not tell him which way the fox ran.<br />With his hoof on my breast, I will not tell him where<br />the black boy hides in the swamp.<br />I shall die, but that is all that I shall do for Death;<br />I am not on his pay-roll.<br /><br />I will not tell him the whereabouts of my friends<br />nor of my enemies either.<br />Though he promise me much,<br />I will not map him the route to any man's door.<br />Am I a spy in the land of the living,<br />that I should deliver men to Death?<br />Brother, the password and the plans of our city<br />are safe with me; never through me<br />Shall you be overcome.</span><div><br /></div>
