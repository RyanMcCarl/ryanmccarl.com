Customs grow out of social processes whose details are highly individuated in regards to the type of activity, the individuals involved, their reputational pedigree, the knowledge they have about each other, and so on. &nbsp;Viewing cultural evolution as deeply and densely rooted process may make one doubt the wisdom of government attempts to fine tune, guide, or supplant it. &nbsp;It is highly unlikely that the blunt instruments of government will be well suited to cultivating the growth of delicate, teeming, unique interactions.<br /><br />Daniel B. Klein<br />--"Assurance and Trust in a Great Society." &nbsp;FEE Occasional Paper Two.<br /><br />I kneeled to the crickets trilling<br />underfoot as if about<br />to burst from their crusty shells;<br />and like a child again<br />marveled to hear so clear<br />and brave a music pour<br />from such a small machine.<br /><br />Robert Penn Warren<br />--<i>from</i>&nbsp;"Touch Me"<br /><br /><a name='more'></a><br /><br />Some assert that strict enforcement of contracts is really a way of showing respect for the dignity and freedom of other individuals by taking them at their word.<br /><br />Marvin A.
