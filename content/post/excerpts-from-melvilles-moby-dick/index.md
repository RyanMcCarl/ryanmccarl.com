What does that indignity amount to, weighed, I mean, in the scales of the New Testament? Do you think the archangel Gabriel thinks anything the less of me, because I promptly and respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance? Who aint a slave? Tell me that. Well, then, however the old sea-captains may order me about - however they may thump and punch me about, I have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right; that everybody else is one way or other served in much the same way - either in a physical or metaphysical point of view, that is; and so the universal thump is passed around, and all hands should rub each other's shoulder-blades, and be content.</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;">...</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;">As for me, I am tormented with an everlasting itch for things remote. I love to sail forbidden seas, and land on barbarous coasts.</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;">...</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;">Each silent worshipper seemed purposely sitting apart from the other, as if each silent grief were insular and incommunicable.</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;">...</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;">But Faith, like a jackal, feeds among the tombs, and even from those dead doubts she gathers her most vital hope.</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;">...</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;">I began to be sensible of strange feelings. I felt a melting in me. No more my splintered heart and maddened hand were turned against the wolfish world.</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;">...</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;">One most perilous and long voyage ended, only begins a second; and a second ended, only begins a third, and so on, for ever and for aye. Such is the endlessness, yea, the intolerableness of all earthly effort.</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;">...</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;">'Now then, thou not only wantest to go a-whaling, to find out by experience what whaling is, buy ye also want to go in order to see the world? Was not that what ye said? I thought so.  Well then, just step forward there, and take a peep over the weather-bow, and then back to me and tell me what ye see there.'...</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;"><br /></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;">Going forward and glancing over the weather bow, I perceived that the ship swinging to her anchor with the flood-tide, was now obliquely pointing towards the open ocean. The prospect was unlimited, but exceedingly monotonous and forbidding; not the slightest variety that I could see.</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;"><br /></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;">'Well, what's the report?' said Peleg when I came back; 'what did ye see?'</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;"><br /></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;">'Not much,' I replied - 'nothing but water; considerable horizon though, and there's a squall coming up, I think.'</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;"><br /></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;">'Well, what dost thou think then of seeing the world? Do ye wish to go round Cape Horn to see any more of it, eh? Can't ye see the world where you stand?'</span></div><div><br /></div><div>Herman Melville</div><div>  --<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">Moby-Dick</span></div>
