<em>From</em> <strong>The Passage</strong><br /><br />What waiting in the halls,<br />stamping on the stairs,<br />all the ghosts are here tonight<br />come from everywhere.<br /><br />Yet one or two,<br />absent, make<br />themselves felt by that,<br />break the heart.<br /><br /><strong>I Know a Man<br /></strong><br />As I sd to my<br />friend, because I am<br />always talking, --John, I<br /><br />sd, which was not his<br />name, the darkness sur-<br />rounds us, shall we &<br />why not, buy a goddam big car,<br /><br />drive, he sd, for<br />christ’s sake, look<br />out where yr going.<br /><br /><strong>Goodbye<br /></strong><br />She stood at the window. There was<br />a sound, a light.<br />She stood at the window. A face.<br /><br />Was it that she was looking for,<br />he thought. Was it that<br />she was looking for. He said,<br /><br />turn from it, turn<br />from it. The pain is<br />not unpainful. Turn from it.<br /><br />The act of her anger, of<br />the anger she felt then,<br />not turning to him.<br /><br /><strong>The Rain</strong><br /><br />All night the sound had<br />come back again,<br />and again falls<br />this quiet, persistent rain.<br /><br />What am I to myself<br />that must be remembered,<br />insisted upon<br />so often?  Is it<br /><br />that never the ease,<br />even the hardness,<br />of rain falling<br />will have for me<br /><br />something other than this,<br />something not so insistent -<br />am I to be locked in this<br />final uneasiness.<br /><br />Love, if you love me,<br />lie next to me.<br />Be for me, like rain,<br />the getting out<br /><br />of the tiredness, the fatuousness, the semi-<br />lust of intentional indifference.<br />Be wet<br />with a decent happiness.<br /><br />--<em>From </em><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Collected-Poems-Robert-Creeley-1975-2005/dp/0520241592/ref=sr_1_2/105-9091640-2812447?ie=UTF8&s=books&amp;qid=1184758394&amp;sr=8-2">Selected Poems</a></strong><em> by Robert Creeley</em>
