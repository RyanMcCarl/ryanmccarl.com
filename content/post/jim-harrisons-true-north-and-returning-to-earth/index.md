I've made plenty of discoveries this year - a love for banjo and bluegrass, a greater appreciation for the outdoors and concern for the environment, a new appreciation for the upper Midwest, the desire (if not yet the discipline) to live more simply and learn to cook - but one of the best recent discoveries I've made is the fiction of Jim Harrison.<br /><br />I recently finished his <em><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=wW5CXWQNt6IC">Returning to Earth</a></em> - a novel about a very physically-oriented man who comes down with Lou Gehrig's disease in his early 40s - and I cannot recommend it enough.  It is a sequel of sorts to Harrison's <em><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=pAVWwx2g9CAC">True North</a></em>, and these two books are the first I've read this year to make my list of fiction favorites.<br /><br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_dbkE5wB5Kaw/SPVs4Z9CtTI/AAAAAAAAAgU/UxfZ_-ewCW8/s1600-h/returning+to+earth.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_dbkE5wB5Kaw/SPVs4Z9CtTI/AAAAAAAAAgU/UxfZ_-ewCW8/s200/returning+to+earth.jpg" border="0" alt='"id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5257227856320312626" /></a><br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_dbkE5wB5Kaw/SPVsxC9H-lI/AAAAAAAAAgM/JxugjoVWP-A/s1600-h/truenorth.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_dbkE5wB5Kaw/SPVsxC9H-lI/AAAAAAAAAgM/JxugjoVWP-A/s200/truenorth.jpg" border="0" alt='"id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5257227729887558226" /></a><br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_dbkE5wB5Kaw/SPVsqCXCI3I/AAAAAAAAAgE/15eFmT9sDZk/s1600-h/jimharrison.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_dbkE5wB5Kaw/SPVsqCXCI3I/AAAAAAAAAgE/15eFmT9sDZk/s320/jimharrison.jpg" border="0" alt='"id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5257227609468707698" /></a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />The following links are also worth checking out:<br /><br />-<em>New York Times</em> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/25/books/25harr.html">interview</a> with Jim Harrison: "Pleasures of the Hard-Worn Life"<br />-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Harrison">Wikipedia article </a>on Jim Harrison<br />-<em>New York Times</em> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/11/books/review/Blythe.t.html?_r=1&pagewanted=2&oref=slogin">review</a> of <em>Returning to Earth</em> (warning: gives a lot away).
