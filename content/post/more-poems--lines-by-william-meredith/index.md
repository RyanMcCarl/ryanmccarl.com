<strong>Original Aversions</strong><br /><br />In all respects unready for a fall<br />They fell, our first progenitors, and these<br />Two traumas still disturb us most of all:<br />High places and our own unreadiness.<br />Towers or wells unfoot us in our dreams<br />Repeatedly. Old-fashioned people still<br />Believe that nothing saves them but their screams<br />And that an unawakened fall would kill.<br />Anticipation cannot really ease<br />The other trouble; waiting for the day<br />When such and such will happen or will pass,<br />It is not hard to wish your life away.<br />Apart from angels, winged and prevised,<br />Nobody likes to fall or be surprised.<br /><br /><em>From</em> <strong>Starlight</strong><br /><br />Going abruptly into a starry night<br />It is ignorance we blink from, dark, unhoused;<br />There is a gaze of animal delight<br />Before the human vision. Then, aroused<br />To nebulous danger, we may look for east stars,<br />Orion and the Dipper; but they are not ours,<br /><br />These learned fields. Dark and ignorant,<br />Unable to see what our forebears saw,<br />We keep some fear of random firmament<br />Vestigal in us. And we think, Ah,<br />If I had lived then, when these stories were made up, I<br />Could have found more likely pictures in haphazard sky.<br /><br /><em>From</em> <strong>Sonnet on Rare Animals</strong><br /><br />I have alarmed on your behalf and others'<br />Sauntering things galore.<br />It is this way with verse and animals<br />And love, that when you point you lose them all.<br />Startled or on a signal, what is rare<br />Is off before you have it anywhere.<br /><br /><em>From</em> <strong>Orpheus</strong><br /><br />The mind turns from causes in such cases -<br />All a man can say is, it happened.
