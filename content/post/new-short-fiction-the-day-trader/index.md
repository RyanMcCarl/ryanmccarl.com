"The Day-Trader," my most recent short story, is being featured in the July issue of <em><a href="http://foggedclarity.com/">Fogged Clarity</a></em>.  Check it out <a href="http://foggedclarity.com/2009/06/the-day-trader/">here</a>.  <br /><br />There is a lot of great stuff in this issue - fiction, poetry, a short film, visual art, a music album, and an essay - so be sure to check out the other pieces as well.  If you like what you see, you can support <em>Fogged Clarity</em> by linking to it, passing it along to others, and making a <a href="http://foggedclarity.com/donations/">donation</a>.
