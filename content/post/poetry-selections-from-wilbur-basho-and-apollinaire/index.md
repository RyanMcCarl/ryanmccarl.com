<em>From</em> <strong>Transit</strong><br /><br />A woman I have never seen before<br />Steps from the darkness of her town-house door<br />At just that crux of time when she is made<br />So beautiful that she or time must fade.<br /><br />-Richard Wilbur<br /><br /><em>From</em> <strong>Journey of the Year 1694</strong><br /><br />I trudged alone far into Yoshino. The mountains truly stretch on and on, and white clouds lie piled on the peaks. A smoky rain buried the valleys, here and there interrupted by the huts of the mountain folk, very small. To the west, the sound of a tree being felled; to the east, the echo. The voices of the bells of many temples found a response deep in my heart.<br />...<br />Weary of sleeping every night in strange lodgings, I got up from bed while it was still dark and went out onto the beach.<br />...<br />As the days went by in travel, untying my straw sandals at this place and laying down my walking stick at that, the year drew to a close.<br /><br />-Basho (tr. Donald Keene)<br /><br /><em>From</em> <strong>Mirabeau Bridge</strong><br /><br />All love goes by as water to the sea<br />All love goes by<br />How slow life seems to me<br />How violent the hope of love can be.<br /><br />-Guillaume Apollinaire (tr. Richard Wilbur)
