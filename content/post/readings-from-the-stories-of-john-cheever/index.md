They come from Buffalo and Chicago and the Far West, through Albany and down along the river in the early morning, and at one time or another I've traveled on most of them, and I lay in the dark thinking about the polar air in the Pullman cars and the smell of nightclothes and the taste of dining-car water and the way it feels to end a day in Cleveland or Chicago and begin another in New York, particularly after you've been away for a couple of years, and particularly in the summer.<br />...<br />I took the eight-ten train into town in the morning and returned on the six-thirty.  I knew enough to avoid the empty house in the summer dusk, and I drove directly from the station parking lot to a good restaurant called Orpheo's.<br /><br />--"The Cure"<br /><br />"The sun is in your hair."<br />"What?"<br />"The sun is in your hair.  It's a beautiful color."<br /><br />--"The Chaste Clarissa"<br /><br /><a name='more'></a><br /><br />I felt that he was a captive of financial and sentimental commitments, like every other man I know, and that he was no more free to fall in love with a strange woman he saw on a street corner than he was to take a walking trip through French Guiana or to recommence his life in Chicago under an assumed name.<br />...<br />"Is divorce so dreadful and of all the things that hold a marriage together how many of them are good?" She sat down at the table.  "In Grenoble," she said, "I wrote a long paper on Charles Stuart in French.  A professor at the University of Chicago wrote me a letter.  I couldn't read a French newspaper without a dictionary today, I don't have the time to follow any newspaper, and I am ashamed of my incompetence, ashamed of the way I look.  Oh, I guess I love you, I do love the children, but I love myself, I love my life, it has some value and some promise for me and Trencher's roses make me feel that I'm losing this, that I'm losing my self-respect."<br />...<br />Walking down Lexington Avenue, we heard the drone bass of a church organ sound from the sky, and we and the others on the sidewalk looked up in piety and bewilderment, like a devout and stupid congregation, and saw a formation of heavy bombers heading for the sea.  As it got late, it got cold and clear and still, and on the stillness the waste from the smokestacks along the East River seemed to articulate, as legibly as the Pepsi-Cola plane, whole words and sentences.  Halcyon.  Disaster.  They were hard to make out.  It seemed the ebb of the year - an evil day for gastritis, sinus, and respiratory disease - and remembering other winters, the markings of the light convinced me that it was the season of divorce.<br />...<br />I think that the seriousness of the day affected the children, and when they returned to the house, they were quiet.  The seriousness of it kept coming to me with the feeling that this change, like a phenomenon of speed, was affecting our watches as well as our hearts.<br />...<br />Now when I come home in the evenings, Ethel is still sitting on the stool by the sink cleaning vegetables.  I go with her into the children's room.  The light there is bright.  The children have built something out an orange crate, something preposterous and ascendant, and their sweetness, their compulsion to build, the brightness of the light are reflected perfectly and increased in Ethel's face.  Then she feeds them, bathes them, and sets the table, and stands for a moment in the middle of the room, trying to make some connection between the evening and the day.  Then it is over.  She lights the four candles, and we sit down to our supper.<br /><br />--"The Season of Divorce"<br /><br />It is true of even the best of us that if an observer can catch us boarding a train at a way station; if he will mark our faces, stripped by anxiety of their self-possession; if he will appraise our luggage, our clothing, and look out of the window to see who has driven us to the station; if he will listen to the harsh or tender things we say if we are with our families, or notice the way we put our suitcase onto the rack, check the position of our wallet, our key ring, and wipe the sweat off the back of our necks; if he can judge sensibly the self-importance, diffidence, or sadness with which we settle ourselves, he will be given a broader view of our lives than most of us would intend.<br /><br />--"The Summer Farmer"
