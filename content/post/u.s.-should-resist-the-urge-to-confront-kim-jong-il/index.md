In it, I make the case that any honest examination of the U.S.'s policy options regarding North Korea must begin with the acknowledgment that, first, war is not an option, and second, that the strategies of isolation and sanctions have been tried and have failed for 60 years.  Accordingly, our only chance for a resolution of the North Korean issue is through direct talks with the North aimed at a comprehensive peace settlement and an official end to the Korean War.  This is not a pleasant option, but it is the right one.<br /><br />Read the article and the argument <a href="http://original.antiwar.com/mccarl/2009/06/30/resist-the-urge-to-confront-kim-jong-il/">here</a>; please feel free to comment directly on the site, through a letter to the editor, or via <a href="mailto:ryan.mccarl@gmail.com">email</a>.
