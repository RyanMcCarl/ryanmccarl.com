My latest op-ed, "<a href="http://original.antiwar.com/mccarl/2009/06/14/war-the-more-we-spend/">War: The More We Spend on It, the More We Get</a>," appeared on <a href="http://antiwar.com/">Antiwar.com</a> this morning.<br /><br />In it, I write:<br /><br />"President Obama and Defense Secretary Gates’ $534 billion defense budget proposal is aimed at building a "21st-century military," that is, a military designed to fight asymmetrical "small wars," conduct anti-terrorism operations, and battle insurgencies. It shuffles a significant number of pieces around the chessboard, to be sure, but like its predecessors, it is an enormous waste of resources and wealth.<br /><br />If we took a radically different, need-based approach to defense funding, and asked ourselves about the legitimate, just, and necessary aims of American power, and how much money we must allocate to defense to accomplish those aims, it is unlikely that we would wind up where we are now, with 20 percent of our national budget allocated to defense and accounting for a shameful 45 percent of the world’s spending on war and preparation for war.<br />...<br />Insofar as Obama and Gates are shaking up the military-industrial status quo, they deserve some credit. But the simple fact that their defense budget represents an increase in an already criminal level of funding for warmaking and its instruments demonstrates that whatever special interests are threatened by the new budget, this budget will create new special interests of its own.<br /><br />What is needed is a dramatic cut in defense spending. To think that this would represent a decrease, rather than an increase, in America’s security is a reflex rather than the product of reflection; the safest world is one in which spending on war is minimized as much as possible."<br /><br />Read the whole article <a href=http://original.antiwar.com/mccarl/2009/06/14/war-the-more-we-spend/>here</a>.
