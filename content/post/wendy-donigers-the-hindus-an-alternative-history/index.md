Doniger, the Mircea Eliade Distinguished Service Professor of Religions at the University of Chicago Divinity School and America's foremost scholar of Hinduism, set out to challenge many prevailing notions of Hinduism and argue for a more inclusive, broad view of the tradition, a view that recognizes the diversity of folk religions in the Hindu world as well as the contributions of women, Muslims, and people of the lower castes to the Hindu tradition.<br /><br />The book was reviewed last weekend in the <em>New York Times Book Review</em>, and it is slated to be chosen as an Editor's Pick next week.  A comment by Professor Doniger can be found <a href="http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/panelists/wendy_doniger/2009/03/the_battle_over_hindu_history.html">here</a>, and the favorable <em>Times</em> review by Pankaj Mishra can be found <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/26/books/review/Mishra-t.html?_r=1&ref=books">here</a>.
